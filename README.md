README file for OpenEA MT5 Code

This code is an implementation of an automated trading program called OpenEA MT5. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and is based on the OpenEA MT5 trading strategy. The purpose of this program is to trade the EURUSD currency pair on the H1 timeframe.

To run this code, you will need to have MetaTrader 5 installed and set up with the required libraries. The necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the code, including 'stdio.mqh', 'stdlib.mqh', 'array.mqh', and 'math.mqh'.

The code defines several constants that can be modified according to your trading preferences. These constants include the symbol to trade (SYMBOL), the timeframe (TIMEFRAME), the lot size (LOT_SIZE), take profit (TAKE_PROFIT), and stop loss (STOP_LOSS) levels.

The code also defines a global variable for the current Bid and Ask prices, which will be used for placing buy and sell orders. The OnTick function is the main function that will be executed on every tick of the market. It first retrieves the current Bid and Ask prices using the SymbolInfoDouble function.

If the Bid price is higher than the Ask price, the code places a buy order. The stop loss and take profit levels are calculated based on the Bid and Ask prices and the defined stop loss and take profit values. The OrderSend function is used to place the buy order, and the result is checked to ensure the order was placed successfully.

If the Bid price is lower than the Ask price, the code places a sell order. The stop loss and take profit levels are calculated similarly to the buy order. Again, the OrderSend function is used to place the sell order, and the result is checked.

The OnInit function is called at the start of the program and prints information about the program and the developer. It also sets up the chart properties, such as making the chart background transparent and shifting the chart one bar to the left.

The OnDeinit function is called at the end of the program and prints a completion message. It also resets the chart properties to their original values.

The OnOptimization function is called when the program is run in optimization mode. It performs the optimization process, which in this code is a simple loop that completes 10 optimization steps. A message is printed for each step, and a completion message is printed at the end.

The main function is the entry point of the program. It calls the OnInit function to initialize the program, simulates trading activity by calling the OnTick function in a loop, waits for 1 second between each tick, performs the optimization by calling the OnOptimization function, and finally calls the OnDeinit function to deinitialize the program.
